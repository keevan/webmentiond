# Getting started

1. You need to have an SMTP server through which the server can send you
   e-mails. This is necessary in order to authenticate with the management UI.
   Put the credentials for your SMTP account into the folowing environment
   variables:

   - `MAIL_HOST`
   - `MAIL_PORT`
   - `MAIL_USER`
   - `MAIL_PASSWORD`
   - `MAIL_FROM`

   If you don't have a mailserver that supports TLS set the environment
   variable `MAIL_NO_TLS` to `true`.

2. Pick an allowed e-mail address that can be used to log in and write it into
   the `AUTH_ADMIN_EMAILS` environment variable.

3. Pick a secret key that should be used to sign the tokens generated by the
   server and store that in the `AUTH_JWT_SECRET` environment variable. 

Now that you have all that, start the server with the following command:

```
$ docker run --rm \
		-e "MAIL_USER=${MAIL_USER}" \
		-e "MAIL_PORT=${MAIL_PORT}" \
		-e "MAIL_HOST=${MAIL_HOST}" \
		-e "MAIL_PASSWORD=${MAIL_PASSWORD}" \
		-e "MAIL_FROM=${MAIL_FROM}" \
		-v ${PWD}/data:/data \
		-p 8080:8080 \
		zerok/webmentiond:latest \
		--addr 0.0.0.0:8080 \
		--auth-jwt-secret ${AUTH_JWT_SECRET} \
		--auth-admin-emails ${AUTH_ADMIN_MAILS} \
		--allowed-target-domains ${ALLOWED_TARGET_DOMAINS}
```

When you now go to http://localhost:8080/ui/ you will see a login dialog where
you can enter your admin e-mail address. For details on the authentication
flow, please take a look at the "Authentication flow" section below.
